## Building models

* If at all possible, build models using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/)
* Make sure code is modular and well-documented
* Contribute model code to [`behavioural_modelling`](https://github.com/tobywise/behavioural-modelling) if appropriate

## Fitting models
* See [this paper](https://elifesciences.org/articles/49547) for some useful advice on fitting models
