In order to standardise the way we build models and make our modelling code maximally reusable, we have developed a package that contains a set of functions that can be used to build behavioural models. This package is called `behavioural_modelling` and is available on our GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/tobywise/behavioural-modelling).

The package is built on top of [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), ensuring that it is fast and can be run on different hardware (e.g., GPUs). It is primarily focused on trialwise learning models.
